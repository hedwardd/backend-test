# Backend Programming Challenge

## Assignment

This is a challenge to test your ability to build API endpoints to be used in web applications. For this challenge, please use Node js and express. Please store relevant information in a database: MongoDB is preferred but not required. Do not worry about deploying to a remote server, just launch and test your server locally. Your ability to create RESTful endpoints with readable and extendible code will be taken into consideration.
